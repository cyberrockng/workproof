# pre-build.sh — Deploy WorkProofEscrow and register it as an FCC extension.
#
# Deploys the real production WorkProofEscrow contract (NOT the scaffold's
# sample HelloWorldInstructionSender -- WorkProofEscrow is itself the
# instruction sender, so no second wrapper contract is needed), registers
# it against the FlareTeeManager diamond (register-extension is already
# fully generic and needs no WorkProof-specific changes), then calls
# WorkProofEscrow.setExtensionId() so it adopts the id the registration
# step just created.
#
# Inputs (env vars):
#   ADDRESSES_FILE  — path to deployed-addresses.json (auto-detected if unset)
#   CHAIN_URL       — chain RPC URL (default: http://127.0.0.1:8545)
#   DEPLOYMENT_PRIVATE_KEY — funded private key (default: Hardhat account)
#   WORKPROOF_TREASURY — required; the escrow's protocol-fee recipient
#   WORKPROOF_PROTOCOL_FEE_BPS — optional, defaults to 100 (1%)
#
# Outputs:
#   config/extension.env — EXTENSION_ID, INSTRUCTION_SENDER, and
#                           WORKPROOF_ESCROW_ADDRESS (same address as
#                           INSTRUCTION_SENDER for WorkProof -- both names
#                           are kept so existing generic scripts that read
#                           INSTRUCTION_SENDER/EXTENSION_ID keep working
#                           unchanged)
#   config/deploy.log    — stderr from Go deploy commands
